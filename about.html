    </header>
    <main>
        <p>I received my B.S. in Physics in December of 2023 from Bowling Green State University (BGSU). During that time I have been a part of several research opportunities including a selective National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (NSF-REU) at the University of Toledo and a Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Along with this, I contributed to the physics labs at BGSU, which focused on computational and experimental solar cells and quantum dot performance.</p>

        <p>I started my academic experience in the architecture program at BGSU but that work, while very interesting, gave me chills down my spine when I heard the less glamorous side of designing parking lots and hours of CAD chair placements. However, I am still an avid urbanist and take great joy in looking at progress in building materials.</p>

        <p>Once I found out I no longer wanted to pursue architecture, I did some soul-searching and decided on physics. Of course, it is the next logical progressive step right?! However odd that may be, I had my reasons and I am very happy with the undergraduate experience I had! So much so, my goal is to pursue a PhD before 40. No need to rush these things, though I do hope I can get it done much sooner.</p>

        <p>My interests vary, but I know I would like to gain a lifestyle around bettering the world through education and technology. I feel this website has the potential to act as a catalyst for it.</p>

        <p>If you made it this far congrats! I am flattered you are interested in my thoughts and yapping. I sincerely Thank you for checking out my website and hope we can stay in touch!</p>
